<h2 id="about">Who is this person</h2>
<p>
	As you've probably read in the title, my name is Germ√°n. I
	am {% include functions/age.html %} years old (this is not relevant information,
	I just wanted to write a tiny script to calculate my age). I am currently a
	Computer Science student and in my free time I'm kind of a web developer.
</p>
<p>
	I like science and technology related topics, but I am specially
	interested in Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and space.
	I like to <del>fangrirl</del> read about it and think about their philosophical implications.
	These topics fill me with excitement, although they scare me a bit at the
	same time. There is proverb that says <cite>Curiosity killed the cat</cite>.
	I hope is not the case, because I want to know what's behind it (in this
	century, if possible).
</p>
<p>
	Also I am very concerned about privacy and freedom. That's why I
	declare myself a Free Software defender. I am a staunch Linux user,
	although I am not <i>R. Stallman</i>, so I have a phone and you can find me on
	some "suspicious" social networks out there.
