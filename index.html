<h2 id="about">Who is this person</h2>
<p>
	Hey, my name is Germ√°n and I'm a <i>Computer Science</i> student. I like free
	software and so I try to help as much as I can, both contributing to
	existing projects or creating some on my own. You probably found me because
	of this fact. Welcome to my website!
