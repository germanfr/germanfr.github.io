title: My first blog entry
---
Hi, this is my first entry in this blog. This will be a personal blog where I will talk about personal things. I'm a technology passionate so I will probably write about it too. This is a very first version of the page, so don't expect very much.

I want to write a "behind the scenes" or "how was it done" entry, so that anyone can know how I made this site and how they can build its own. That will probably be one of my next posts. There is no need for it because it is already very well documented, but I'd like to give people a place of reference.

See you soon!
